## Lesson 3a

1. `mais` ---> but

The world is spelled `M A I S`, but you pronounce it as though there isn't a `s` at the end. (`mai`)

There is a funny thing about consonants in French. You rarely pronounce them when they're at the end of a word. The only consonants you pronounce on the ends of words in Fench are the letters `C`, `R`, `F`, and `L`. And remember them because they appear in the world `C`A`R`E`F`U`L`. 

**`C`, `R`, `F`, and `L` are the only consonants that you pronounce at the end of words in French ** 

E.g.

**sa<u>c</u>** ---> bag

**pou<u>r</u>** ---> full

**bœu<u>f</u>** ---> beef

**norma<u>l</u>** ---> normal

> It is delicious but it isn't very good for me. ---> `C'est délicieux mais ce ńest pas très bon pour moi`
